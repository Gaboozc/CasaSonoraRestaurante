# HTML Hello

The most basic boilerplate for Casa Sonora Restaurant website, developed by AlphaDev.

> There is a video tutorial on [how to use this template to create your very first website here](https://youtu.be/dfbDCMu_p-0).

## What to do next?

Create an `index.html` file with the basic HTML structure and see it live by running a web-server using the following command:

```bash
$ pip3 install flask && python3 server.py
```

- You can create as many HTML files as you want.
- You can also create CSS files and import them into your website using a `<link>` tag placed between the `<head></head>` tags, like this:

```html
<head>
  ...
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css" />
  ...
</head>
```
